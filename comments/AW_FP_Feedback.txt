Time on this part  10 hours
Total for the project 18.5 hours not including the work from FP 01

Questions:
Are you pleased with your progress so far?
	If yes, why?

	Yes I am Pleased with my work so far mostly. I make everything simple because doing the styling is not really my thing
 	and I work very slow so it takes me a long time to get very little done.

	If no, why?
Is there anything you need from me?

No not as of right now.

Feedback/Fixes:

Rene: 
	Matthew, for your gigs, add the name of the establishment to the location. If these are fictious locations, just make up names.
	 If they are real places, explore an API to Google Maps when they are clicked on. If I recall, it's not hard, but do not spend a
	 lot of time trying to figure it out. That and your "reimagine" can lead to scope creep. :)

	On the homepage, on the small screen, there is enough distance between the edge and the words to make it comfortable looking. 
	Not so much on the large screen. There, "Experience" and "Fleet!" go right to the edge.

	It's the reverse for your nav. One the large screen that looks good, but on the small screen "Contact" is right against the edge. SlickNav?

Fixes:  
	Thank you Rene, I added SlickNav to my project and it seems to be working well for the most part. I fixed the issue with the paragraph
	on my index page being too close to the edges. On my gigs page Since it is made up I did add some locations for the events which are
	also made up places. I was able to fix the nav menue so that contact is no longer touching the edge of the screen. I added a page 
	called thank_you so when someone submits information on the contact page they get directed to the thank you page. The heading on the 
	page still reads Contact rather than thank you so that it would appear to the user that they never left the contact page. Also I 
	added a favicon ico image for the tab.

Matthew, great idea. I am a rock fan and look forward to seeing your finished project. Love the way you did your presentation. 40 hours is realistic, but you are correct, it could take longer.
